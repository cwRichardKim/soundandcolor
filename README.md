# soundandcolor
Senior Capstone with Jay DeStories, Nick Usoff, and Richard Kim

The high level goal of the project is to find intuitive ways to map music to one or more colors, with the end results being applications that enable more effective learning and more expressive performance. To that end, we hope to use color as feedback to signify information such as probable scale, modality, and pitch.
